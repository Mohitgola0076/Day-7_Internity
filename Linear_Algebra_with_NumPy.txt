The NumPy linear algebra functions rely on BLAS and LAPACK to provide efficient low level implementations of standard linear algebra algorithms. 

Those libraries may be provided by NumPy itself using C versions of a subset of their reference implementations but, when possible, highly optimized libraries that take advantage of specialized processor functionality are preferred.

Examples of such libraries are OpenBLAS, MKL (TM), and ATLAS.

The SciPy library also contains a linalg submodule, and there is overlap in the functionality provided by the SciPy and NumPy submodules.
